KEYBOARD
The keyboard controls worked very well for controlling Snake. They were fast and it was easy to remember which direction was
which.

ALTERNATE KEYBOARD
Our alternate keyboard controls were very similar, as they shared the same shape as the arrow keys. So it was easy to
remember. On Nicholas' laptop, the arrow keys are half the size of the regular letter keys, so our alternate controls were much
easier to press because of that.

TRACKPAD
The trackpad worked well enough. It was interesting in that you could dictate a new direction by only slightly moving the
finger in that direction. However, it also felt less precise in that if your finger moved slightly in a different direction
than what thou doth intended (perhaps you wished to move to the right, but your finger moved a bit up at the end), the input
might be interpreted in an undesirable way. In this way, it felt less reliable than the keys.

COLORED OBJECT
The colored object based movement was so cool.

HAND RECOGNITION
Using the amount of fingers one was holding up as an input was just so much fun. Nicholas is one that struggles with hand
gestures however, and is very slow at forming them. This made controlling a game with them very difficult, especially with
Snake, where very fast reaction time can be necessary for controlling the snake as it nears the edge of its desmene.

UNIQUE CONTROLS (GAMEPAD THUMBSTICK CONTROLS)
The gamepad thumbstick controls were very usable for Snake. It was intuitive and easy to remember to point the thumbstick in the
direction that I want the Snake to go. Our implementation of it meant that you have to hold down the thumbstick in that direction,
whereas pointing the thumbstick and then releasing it once the Snake was heading in your desired direction is perhaps a yet
more intuitive and convienent way to control our Snake fellow.
